# Advent of Code 🎄

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges.


## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event that features daily programming puzzles throughout December. It's a fun way to explore new problem-solving techniques and programming languages. 🌟


## Structure

- Each day's challenge is organized into its respective folder (e.g., `Day 1`, `Day 2`, etc.).
- Inside each day's folder, there are two folders for `Part 1` and `Part 2` of the problem.
- Inside each folder, you'll find:
  - `README.md`: Explanation of the problem and approach. (I'll add these later on)
  - `solution.py` and `solution.go`: Code solutions in Python and Go.
  - Any additional resources or input files required for the solution. 📁
- The file scripts.ps1 has the powershell scripts that I am using for this project you can change them to their bash equivalent if you want.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and use these solutions for reference. However, I encourage you to attempt solving the challenges yourself first before checking the solutions here. 🚀

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Advent-of-Code.git
    ```

2. Navigate to a specific day's folder.

3. Run the solution code and adjust input files or parameters as needed. 🖥️
