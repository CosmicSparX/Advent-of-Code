# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event that features daily programming puzzles throughout December. It's a fun way to explore new problem-solving techniques and programming languages.

## Structure

- Each day's challenge is organized into its respective folder (e.g., `Day 1`, `Day 2`, etc.).
- Inside each day's folder there are two folders for `Part 1` and `Part 2` of the problem.
- Inside each folder, you'll find:
  - `README.md`: Explanation of the problem and approach. (I'll add these later on)
  - `solution.py` and `solution.go`: Code solutions in python and go.
  - Any additional resources or input files required for the solution.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and use these solutions for reference. However, I encourage you to attempt solving the challenges yourself first before checking the solutions here.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Advent-of-Code.git
    ```

2. Navigate to a specific day's folder:

3. Run the solution code and adjust input files or parameters as needed.
